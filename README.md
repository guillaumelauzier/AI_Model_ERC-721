# AI_Model_ERC-721

To incorporate an AI model into an Ethereum ERC-721 token, you would first need to train the AI model on your desired dataset and save the trained model in a format that can be loaded and used in your Ethereum contract. Once the trained model is ready, you can then create an Ethereum smart contract that defines the behavior of your ERC-721 token, including the functions that allow you to interact with the AI model.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Solidity, the programming language used for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

After implementing and deploying the AIArt contract to the Ethereum blockchain as shown in this example, users can then interact with the contract using a web3 wallet or other Ethereum client to create new AI art tokens and retrieve their images. For example, a user could use the createAIArt function to generate a new AI art token with a given input data, and then use the getAIArtImage function to retrieve the image of the generated token.

Additionally, the AIArt contract could be extended to include other functions, such as functions for transferring ownership of the AI art tokens, setting a price for the tokens, or allowing users to provide feedback and ratings for the generated images. These additional functions could be implemented in the AIArt contract and then used by users to further interact with and utilize the AI model within the Ethereum blockchain.
