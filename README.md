# AI_Model_ERC-721

To incorporate an AI model into an Ethereum ERC-721 token, you would first need to train the AI model on your desired dataset and save the trained model in a format that can be loaded and used in your Ethereum contract. Once the trained model is ready, you can then create an Ethereum smart contract that defines the behavior of your ERC-721 token, including the functions that allow you to interact with the AI model.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Solidity, the programming language used for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

In this example, the AIArt contract extends the ERC721 contract, which defines the basic functionality of an ERC-721 token. The AIArt contract also imports the MyAIModel contract, which represents the trained AI model that will be used to generate the images for the AI art tokens. The AIArt contract defines a createAIArt function that allows users to create new AI art tokens by providing some input data to the AI model, and a getAIArtImage function that allows users to retrieve the image of an AI art token with a given token ID.
